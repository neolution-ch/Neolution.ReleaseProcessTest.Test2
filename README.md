# Release Process for Packages

This document describes the simplified and automated release process for our Open Source packages.

## Requirements & Goals

Our release process is designed to achieve the following:
- **Automation:** Automate as much as possible to reduce human error. The act of releasing should be a routine, low-risk event.
- **Simplicity:** The process should be simple enough for any team member to perform a standard release with confidence.
- **Consistency:** The process is the same for all packages, ensuring predictable and reliable releases.
- **Clarity:** Maintain a clear and useful `CHANGELOG.md` for our users, following the Keep a Changelog standard.
- **Adherence to Standards:** Strictly follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to communicate the impact of our changes.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **The `main` branch is the source of truth.** It always contains the code for the *next* potential release and should always be in a stable state.
2.  **Developers interact with the GitHub UI, not complex Git commands.** Releases are triggered via a GitHub Actions workflow, not from a local machine.
3.  **The `CHANGELOG.md` is our contract.** Every user-facing change must be accompanied by an entry in the changelog.
4.  **Releases are marked by tags, not branches.** The `main` branch is the only long-lived branch. All other branches (`feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`) are temporary and must be deleted after their purpose is served.
5.  **Main branch is protected - all merges must be via pull request. Only the GitHub release-bot may merge directly for changelog updates.**

## Tools

To achieve these goals, we will use the following tools and standards:
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
- **Three manual-trigger GitHub Actions** powered by standard command-line tools and actions:
  - `Create Stable Release`: For production releases from main branch
  - `Create Pre-Release`: For alpha/beta/rc releases from main branch
  - `Create Branch Release`: For releases from release/* and hotfix/* branches

## The Developer's Responsibility: The Changelog Contract

This entire automated process relies on one simple rule for every developer.

> **Every Pull Request (PR) that introduces a user-facing change MUST include an update to the `[Unreleased]` section of the `CHANGELOG.md` file.**

PR reviewers are responsible for enforcing this.

**Example `CHANGELOG.md` on the `main` branch:**
```markdown
# Changelog
...
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Feature to export user data to JSON.
- New CancellationToken parameter to `ProcessAsync` method.

### Fixed
- Resolved a null reference exception when the input string is empty.
```

**CHANGELOG Integrity Rules**

- CHANGELOG.md must only be manually edited under the [Unreleased] section.
- During merge conflicts, only resolve conflicts without adding or removing entries.

## How to Release: The Three Paths

There are three release scenarios. The first path will cover the vast majority of all releases, while the other two handle more advanced, less frequent scenarios.

### Path 1: The Standard Release (The Common Case)

**Use this path when you want to release all the new features and fixes that have been merged into the `main` branch.** This process is the same for stable (`1.2.3`), release candidate (`-rc.0`), beta, and alpha releases.

1.  **Go to your repository's "Actions" tab.**
2.  **Select the appropriate workflow:**
    *   For stable releases: Select "Create Stable Release"
    *   For pre-releases (alpha/beta/rc): Select "Create Pre-Release"
3.  **Click the "Run workflow" button.** Make sure the `main` branch is selected.
4.  **Fill out the inputs:**
    *   **For "Create Stable Release":**
        *   **`level`**: Choose `patch`, `minor`, or `major` based on the changes in the "Unreleased" section.
            *   **Important**: If the latest Git tag is a pre-release (e.g., `v1.0.0-alpha.3`), all level options will result in stabilizing to the base version (`v1.0.0`). This is the intended behavior for transitioning from pre-release to stable.
    *   **For "Create Pre-Release":**
        *   **`type`**: Choose `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc` for a pre-release.
        *   **`action`**: Choose `continue` to increment the current pre-release, `transition` to switch to a different pre-release type (e.g., from alpha.1 to beta.0), or `new` to start a new pre-release from stable.
        *   **`level`**: Required when `action` is `new` - choose `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. Ignored for `transition`.
5.  **Click "Run workflow".**

**That's it. The automation handles everything else:**
*   It calculates the new version number based on your input.
*   It reads the contents of the `[Unreleased]` section to use for the release notes.
*   **For `stable` releases only:**
    *   It updates `CHANGELOG.md`: The `[Unreleased]` content is moved under a new version heading (e.g., `[1.3.0] - 2023-10-27`).
    *   It creates a new, empty `[Unreleased]` section.
    *   It commits this updated file back to the `main` branch.
*   It creates a new Git tag (e.g., `v1.3.0` or `v1.3.0-rc.0`).
*   It creates a formal GitHub Release, using the changelog content for the release notes.
*   It builds, packages, and publishes the new version to NuGet.

### Path 2: The Stabilization Release (The Advanced Case)

**Use this path when you need to prepare a major or minor release (e.g., `2.0.0`) while allowing new, unrelated feature development to continue on the `main` branch.** This involves creating a temporary `release/*` branch to act as a feature-frozen staging area.

1.  **Create a Release Branch from `main`.**
    *   Once all features for the upcoming release are on `main`, create the stabilization branch.
    ```bash
    # On your local machine, ensure main is up-to-date
    git checkout main
    git pull
    
    # Create the release branch and push it
    git checkout -b release/v2.0.0
    git push --set-upstream origin release/v2.0.0
    ```
    *From this point, the `release/v2.0.0` branch is feature-frozen. Only fixes for this specific release are allowed. `main` is now free to accept features for the next version (e.g., `2.1.0`).*
    
    *Note: The 'Create Branch Release' workflow automatically detects whether it's running from a `release/*` or `hotfix/*` branch and adjusts version detection accordingly.*
    
    2.  **Publish Pre-Releases (e.g., RCs) from the Release Branch.**
    *   Go to Actions, select the "Create Branch Release" workflow.
    *   **Crucially, use the "Branch" dropdown to select your `release/v2.0.0` branch.**
    *   For the inputs, set the `type` to `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc`. The version will be automatically parsed from the branch name and the appropriate suffix appended (e.g., `2.0.0-rc.0`).

3.  **Apply Bug Fixes to the Release Branch and `main`.**
    *   If a bug is found during testing, commit the fix to the `release/v2.0.0` branch first.
    *   **CRITICAL: Immediately merge the fix back into `main`** to prevent regressions.
    ```bash
    # After committing the fix to release/v2.0.0
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git merge --no-ff release/v2.0.0
    git push
    ```

4.  **Publish the Final Stable Release.**
    *   Run the "Create Branch Release" workflow one last time from the `release/v2.0.0` branch.
    *   Set the `type` to `stable`. The version will be automatically parsed from the branch name.

5.  **Clean up.** The `release/v2.0.0` branch can now be safely deleted.

### Path 3: The Hotfix Release (The Exceptional Case)

**Use this path ONLY when you need to patch an older stable or pre-release version without including all the new features from `main`.** For example, fixing a critical bug in `v1.2.3` when `main` is already on its way to `v2.0.0`.

This process involves a few manual Git commands because it is an exceptional event that requires deliberate, careful action.

1.  **Create a Hotfix Branch from the Old Version's Tag.**
    ```bash
    # On your local machine, check out the specific tag you need to patch
    git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.3 v1.2.3
    ```

    The version number is automatically detected from the latest Git tag in the branch history using release-it. The branch name must start with the `hotfix/` prefix.
    
    *Note: The 'Create Branch Release' workflow automatically detects whether it's running from a `release/*` or `hotfix/*` branch and adjusts version detection accordingly.*
    
    2.  **Apply the Fix.** There are two ways to do this:
    *   **A) The fix is already on `main`:** Cherry-pick the specific commit.
        ```bash
        git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-the-fix-from-main>
        ```
    *   **B) The fix is new:** Make the code changes directly on this hotfix branch and commit them.

3.  **Update the Changelog.** On the `hotfix/v1.2.3` branch, ensure the fix is documented in the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`. The workflow will automatically move it to a new version heading.

4.  **Push the Hotfix Branch.**
    ```bash
    git push --set-upstream origin hotfix/v1.2.3
    ```

5.  **Run the Release Workflow from the Hotfix Branch.**
    *   Go to the "Actions" tab and select the "Create Branch Release" workflow.
    *   **Crucially, use the "Branch" dropdown to select your `hotfix/v1.2.3` branch.**
    *   For the inputs, set the `type` to `stable`. The version will be automatically calculated from the latest Git tag in the branch history.

6.  **Merge the Hotfix Back into `main`.** This is a critical final step to ensure the fix is not lost in future releases.
    *   Since `main` is protected, create a pull request (PR) from the `hotfix/v1.2.3` branch to `main` and merge it through the GitHub UI.
    *   You may need to resolve a small merge conflict in `CHANGELOG.md`. This is expected. Simply ensure the fix is noted in the `[Unreleased]` section of `main`'s changelog. During merge conflict resolution, do not add or remove entries; only resolve the conflict to maintain integrity.

7.  **Clean up.** The `hotfix/v1.2.3` branch can now be safely deleted from GitHub and your local machine.

## Implementation Details

All workflows use [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) with the [keep-a-changelog](https://github.com/release-it/keep-a-changelog) plugin to automate versioning, changelog management, and GitHub releases.

### Pre-Release Flags
- Pre-releases use standard SemVer pre-release identifiers (alpha, beta, rc)
- The `action` parameter controls how the pre-release version is calculated:
  - `continue`: Increments the current pre-release version (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1 → 1.0.0-alpha.2)
  - `transition`: Switches to a different pre-release type while maintaining the base version (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1 → 1.0.0-beta.0)
  - `new`: Starts a new pre-release from the stable version, requiring a `level` parameter to determine the base version increment

### Stable Release Changelog Updates
- For stable releases, the `[Unreleased]` section is moved to a new version heading with the current date
- A new empty `[Unreleased]` section is created and committed back to the main branch
- This ensures the changelog remains current for future development

### Version Detection Methods
- **Stable and Pre-Release workflows**: Version detection based on existing Git tags and the specified level/action parameters
- **Branch releases**:
  - For `release/*` branches: Automatic detection from branch name (e.g., `release/v2.0.0` → `2.0.0`)
  - For `hotfix/*` branches: Automatic detection from Git tag history using release-it's built-in logic
- **Pre-releases**: Complex logic combining action type, existing tags, and user inputs to determine the appropriate version number

### Initial Release

To create the very first release of a package (e.g., `0.1.0`):
1. Ensure your `CHANGELOG.md` file is created and has an `[Unreleased]` section with an entry like "Initial release 🎉".
2. Follow **Path 1: The Standard Release**.
3. Select the "Create Stable Release" workflow.
4. Set the `level` input to `minor`. This will create the `0.1.0` release as the first version.
